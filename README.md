# DrinkingWaterNodes
Find resources to build your own drinking water quality sensor nodes. 

## Platform - Particle IoT
Drinkig water nodes are built upon Particle hardware and IoT infrastructure. The development and implementation of particle.functions and the use of particle libraries within the firmware may only be compatible with Particle's hardware and Particle's back-end cloud communication. The firmware may be modified to work with other hardware and cloud services under your "choose your own adventure" risk.

## Water quality sensors, circuits, functions - Atlas Scientific
All the firmware functions for water quality sensors were modified from the original sample code provided by Atlas Scientific. For clarification on how water quality functions work please visit Atlas Scientific and download the arduino sample code that uses I<sup>2</sup>C.
